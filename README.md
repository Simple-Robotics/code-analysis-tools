Guidelines and notes about useful tools to analyze and optimize code.

The idea is to gather some tools that we use to develop high performance code.

[FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph)

## Finding memory leacks
[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)

## Checking for memory alloctions
Valgrind + [KCachegrind](https://github.com/KDE/kcachegrind)
